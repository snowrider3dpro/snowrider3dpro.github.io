                <h4>Gameplay Overview</h4>

                <h4  id="2">Controls</h4>
                <p>Left Arrow / A: Steer left<br>Right Arrow / D: Steer right<br>Spacebar: Jump</p>
                <h4  id="3">Tips and Strategies</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Master the Controls: Familiarize yourself with the steering and jumping controls. Smooth and precise movements are crucial for avoiding obstacles.</li>
                    <li>Plan Your Path: Look ahead to plan your route. Anticipate obstacles and make gentle adjustments to your trajectory rather than sudden, sharp movements.</li>
                    <li>Collect Gifts: As you navigate the slope, aim to collect gifts. These not only increase your score but can also unlock new snowboards.</li>
                    <li>Use Jumps Wisely: Jumping is not just for avoiding obstacles; it can also help you reach gifts that are off the main path. Time your jumps carefully to maximize their effectiveness.</li>
                    <li>Stay Centered: Try to stay in the center of the slope where possible. This gives you more room to maneuver when obstacles appear suddenly.</li>
                    <li>Practice Makes Perfect: The more you play, the better you'll get at anticipating obstacles and reacting quickly. Each run helps you improve your skills and reaction times.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Unlockable Content</h4>
                <p>Snowboards: As you collect more gifts, you can unlock different snowboards. Each board might offer a slightly different experience or visual appeal.</p>
                <h4>Visuals and Design</h4>
                <p>Snow Rider 3D features simple yet engaging graphics. The gameâ€™s design is intended to be both aesthetically pleasing and functional, ensuring that players can focus on the gameplay without unnecessary distractions.</p>

                    <li>Stress Relief: The snowy, serene environment and the straightforward gameplay can be quite relaxing, making it a good way to unwind.</li>
                    <li>Hand-Eye Coordination: Continuous practice helps in improving hand-eye coordination, especially in navigating through challenging paths.</li>
                </ul>
